### Key Milestones

- **Embracing New Technologies**: Transitioned from traditional web technologies to modern frameworks like Tauri and Svelte.
- **Backend Evolution**: Moved from PHP to Rust, ensuring robust and secure backend solutions.
- **Frontend Development**: Leveraged the power of Svelte and Astro for dynamic and efficient UIs.
- **My own Licenses**: Created 3 licenses for my projects, and I'm using them in all my projects.


## Looking Ahead

As we approach 2024, my focus remains on SvelteKit and TypeScript for frontend and exploring custom Rust-based frameworks for backend development. The journey continues!
