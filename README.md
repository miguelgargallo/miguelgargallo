## The article

Are you curious about the latest advancements in frontend and backend development? Take a journey with a passionate developer as they go from a foundation in HTML and CSS, to mastering the latest technologies such as Tauri, Svelte, and Rust. Discover how they pushed the limits of what’s possible and continue to grow in the ever-evolving world of web development. Get ready for an exciting ride as you learn about the key milestones in this developer’s journey over the past year!

My journey as a developer from March 2022 to February 2023 has been a roller coaster of new frameworks, languages, and servers. It all started with a foundation in HTML and CSS, and a strong understanding of PHP. In April 2022, I was working with MariaDB and hosting my projects on Github Pages.

However, as I continued to grow as a developer, I was eager to explore new technologies. In May 2022, I switched to PostgreSQL and started working with JavaScript (JS). Over the next few months, I continued to expand my knowledge by working with React, TailwindCSS, and Prisma. I also started using TypeScript (TS) to develop my projects.

In October 2022, I made a big leap by exploring Deno as a backend solution and using SurrealDB as my database. This was a challenging and exciting time, as I was able to learn and apply new technologies that allowed me to create more sophisticated applications.

By December 2022, I had transitioned to using Tauri as my backend solution, and I continued to work with it into the new year. In January 2023, I upgraded to using Asto as my frontend framework, and I was able to use TailwindCSS and Svelte to create dynamic user interfaces.

_As I write this article at the end of January, I am now using Astro 2.0 February, as my frontend framework, and I have added Rust to my list of programming languages. I am also hosting my projects on a combination of Vercel and AWS servers._

The integration of Svelte into my Tauri projects has added a new level of complexity and excitement to my development work. Svelte is a reactive and efficient framework that allows for fast and dynamic user interfaces. It has been a great addition to my toolset, and I have been able to create highly interactive and responsive applications with it.

In addition to Svelte, the integration of Rust into my development workflow has been a game-changer. Rust is a powerful and efficient programming language that has allowed me to build robust and secure backends. The combination of Rust and Tauri has been a winning combination, allowing me to build high-performance web applications with ease.

The resurgence of JavaScript and the rise of Tauri has been an exciting time in the development world. Tauri has proved to be a game-changer for frontend and backend development, providing an innovative and secure platform for building web applications. I am proud to be a part of this movement and look forward to continued growth and success in the future.

In conclusion, my journey as a developer from March 2022 to February 2023 has been a testament to my passion for technology and my commitment to constantly learning and growing. I am excited to see what the future holds and to continue pushing the limits of what is possible.

Looking back, it’s amazing to see how much I have grown and accomplished in just one year. I am excited to continue my journey as a developer and see where it takes me next.

In the vast universe of web development, the stars are frameworks and tools that guide us. As we traverse this space, we must ask: What has been the trajectory, and where are we headed?

Miguel Gargallo's roadmap Mar 2022 to Nov 2023The Rise of SvelteKit and TypeScript (2023): The year 2023 has been pivotal in cementing SvelteKit's position in the frontend universe. Paired with TypeScript, its statically typed superpower, developers have experienced a newfound efficiency and predictability. The embrace of TailwindCSS has further augmented the frontend experience, making UI development more intuitive.

On the backend, Node.js continued its reign. With its nimble nature and vast npm ecosystem, it has offered unparalleled flexibility. PostgreSQL, with its robust features and reliability, has emerged as the preferred database, with DataGrip streamlining database operations.

A Look Back: The Evolution of Frontend (2022–2023): As we trace back through 2023, we observe a dynamic landscape. Earlier in the year, Astro made waves, offering developers the promise of faster web performance. However, as the months progressed, the shift towards SvelteKit was evident. This transition wasn't abrupt but was a testament to SvelteKit's efficiency and developer-friendly approach.

Miguel Gargallo's roadmap Mar 2022 to Nov 2023

Backend Retrospective (2022–2023): The backend story has been equally, if not more, riveting. From the initial days of React (NextJS) and the experimentation with Deno, the journey has been about finding the optimal balance between performance and ease of use. The year saw a gradual transition to Tauri, offering a blend of Rust's power and Svelte's simplicity. Vite, with its blazing-fast build tool reputation, made a mark too. The database landscape saw a shift from MariaDB and MySQL to PostgreSQL, signaling the search for more advanced features and scalability.

Looking Ahead: The 2024 Forecast: As we approach December 2023 and look towards 2024, the current trajectory suggests an unwavering commitment to SvelteKit and TypeScript for frontend development. The backend, while currently dominated by Node.js, shows signs of evolution. The latter half of 2024 might witness the rise of a custom Rust-based backend framework. This would signify a move towards more performance-centric, type-safe backend solutions, harnessing the power of Rust.

The development cosmos is ever-evolving. The past year's journey, from Astro to SvelteKit and from React (NextJS) to Node.js, encapsulates the industry's restless pursuit of excellence. As we gear up for 2024, one thing is certain: The voyage of discovery is far from over, and the best is yet to come.
